# NYC Temperature Forecasting

Given the temperature readings of New York City from October 2012 to October 2017 for every hour on the clock, a forecasting model can be developed for prediction of future temperature readings. In this project, different forecasting models are built using techniques such as Simple Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Linear model, and Holt's Winter. Their performance is compared based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) observed for the forecasted values. The dataset consists of about 45,000 observations and, besides time, just one other attribute of temperature readings in Kelvin.
